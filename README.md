Welcome to the Terrestrial Vitrification Project – a smart, Raspberry Pi-powered solution that automates plant care with automated watering and grow lights, real-time moisture monitoring, and (allegedly) stunning timelapse videos. Better yet, it's open-source! Perfect for hobbyists, educators, or IoT enthusiasts building sustainable green spaces!

🚀 Project Overview

This project integrates sensors, relays, a GUI, and camera control to create a fully autonomous greenhouse:
		
	💡Monitors soil moisture via MCP sensor.
		
	💡Automates watering (or grow lights) based on schedules and data.
		
	💡Captures hourly timelapse photos and compiles them into videos.
		
	💡Built with Python for easy customization.
		
🗝️ Key Features:
		
	💡User-friendly GUI (main.py) for control and status.
		
	💡Wide-open source: You can make this project better! Think of the possibilities.
		
	💡Remote design: Tired of having to touch grass to monitor the greenhouse? Now you don't have to!

🛠️ Quick Start

	💡Navigate to project directory:
			cd /home/Gardener/GreenhousePython/primaryPython
			
	💡Activate virtual environment:
		source vir/bin/activate
			
	💡Run the system:
		💡python main.py

This launches the GUI, integrating all modules.

🎯 Your Contribution Tasks
	💡Help polish this into a production-ready system! Focus areas:

	💡Timelapse Automation: Schedule cameraControl.py to run hourly.

	💡Video Rendering: Compile images into MP4 videos (use OpenCV or FFmpeg).

	💡Full Integration: Ensure main.py orchestrates everything seamlessly – handle relay conflicts and error logging.

	💡Enhancements: Add config files, web dashboard, or cloud upload (bonus!).

🔧 Troubleshooting & Notes

	💡Dependencies: Ensure GPIO, camera libs, and Pillow/OpenCV are installed in the venv.

	💡Hardware: Raspberry Pi with moisture sensor, relay, pump, light, and camera module.
